# This is a recruiting assignment
# I had to implement:
# 1. Run request to receive a JSON object with an array of contacts
# 2. The list of contacts should be sorted alphabetically by last_name
# 3. When a user clicks on a contact (list item) the checkbox should toggle on/off and i should console.log IDs of all selected contacts
# 4. Add search at the top of the list that allows to filter the contacts by first_name and last_name. Searching should not cause contacts to become unchecked.
